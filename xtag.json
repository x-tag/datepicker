			"change": "Fired by the <x-datepicker> whenever the submitValue of the datepicker changes or when the value is finalized. In other words, while input fires as the user types, change only fires if this changes the date selected by the datepicker, or if the user hits enter/leaves the datepicker's focus and the date gets parsed into ISO format."

For example, if the user is currently typing 'July 4, 2013' and hasn't left focus yet, the submitValue is '2013-07-04', not 'July 4, 2013'.
